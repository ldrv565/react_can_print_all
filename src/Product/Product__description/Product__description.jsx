        MESH BANNERS

        <p>Rain or shine, make sure your message gets seen with durable, high-quality mesh banners. The water- and UV- resistant material makes them one of our most weatherproof products. Built-in grommets (included free of charge) make it easy to hang them wherever you want. And the mesh weave minimizes the effect of wind by letting it pass right through. It’s time to get noticed by more customers – no matter what’s in the forecast.</p>
        <p>Choosing a mesh, vinyl or retractable banner
            <li>Mesh banners are designed for outdoor use, tough enough to withstand rain, wind and sun.</li>
            <li>Because of the small holes, mesh banners are slightly transparent, and a little less vibrant than vinyl.</li>
            <li>Mesh works well with large fonts and images. A vinyl banner is a better option for complex artwork or designs.</li>
            <li>Working with an interior space that doesn't allow for easy wall hanging? A retractable vinyl banner offers easy and quick setup, with a pre-assembled banner and stand.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Design tips for mesh banners
            <li>Woven texture slightly reduces image clarity, so use simple, high-resolution visuals.</li>
            <li>Since mesh lets some light through, be sure to keep the contrast high to increase visibility.</li>
            <li>Banners are meant to be seen from a distance, so don’t use small fonts or a lot of text.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Setting up for success
            <li>Use zip ties or rope in every grommet for the most stable hold.</li>
            <li>Pull the banner as taut as possible to avoid wind damage.</li>
            <li>If you banner has wrinkles, lay it flat in sunlight to smooth it out.</li>
